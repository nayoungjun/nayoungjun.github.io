title: "Connectomic analysis reveals an interneuron with an integral role in the retinal circuit for night vision"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/nos1
excerpt: 'We combined structural, functional, and optogenetic analyses of the mouse retina to discover that surround inhibition of the AII depends primarily on a single interneuron type, the NOS-1 Amacrine Cell: a multistratified, axon-bearing GABAergic cell, with dendrites in both ON and OFF synaptic layers, but with a pure ON (depolarizing) response to light.'
