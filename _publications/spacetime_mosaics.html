title: "Efficient coding, channel capacity and the emergence of retinal mosaics"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/spacetime_mosaics
excerpt: 'We used efficient coding theory to present a comprehensive account of mosaic organization in the case of natural videos as the retinal channel capacity— the number of simulated RGCs available for encoding—is varied. In addition, we showed theoretically and in simulation that a transition from mosaic alignment to anti-alignment across pairs of cell types is observed with increasing output noise and decreasing input noise. Together, these results offer a unified perspective on the relationship between retinal mosaics, efficient coding, and channel capacity that can help to explain the stunning functional diversity of retinal cell types.<br><br>Code available at: <a href="https://github.com/pearsonlab/efficientcoding">https://github.com/pearsonlab/efficientcoding</a>'
