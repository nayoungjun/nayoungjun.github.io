excerpt: 'What determines the relative arrangement of receptive field mosaics? Short answer: Scene statistics and noise! In this paper, we showed how efficient coding theory, which hypothesizes that the nervous system minimizes the amount of redundant information it encodes, can predict the relative spatial arrangement of ON and OFF mosaics. The most information-efficient arrangements are determined both by levels of noise in the system and the statistics of natural images.'
