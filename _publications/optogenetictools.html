title: "Activation of Distinct Channelrhodopsin Variants Engages Different Patterns of Network Activity"

permalink: /publication/optogenetictools
excerpt: 'We assessed overall neural activation by measuring the amplitude and temporal progression of evoked spiking. Using γ-range (30–80 Hz) local field potential (LFP) power as an assay for local network engagement, we examined the recruitment of cortical network activity by each of the three ChR variants with distinct temporal profiles: Chronos, Chrimson, and ChR2. All variants caused light-evoked increases in firing in vivo, but each demonstrated different temporal patterning of evoked activity. In addition, the three ChRs had distinct effects on cortical γ-band activity. Our findings suggest the properties of optogenetic tools can substantially affect their efficacy in vivo, as well their engagement of circuit resonance. Together, our data suggest that the kinetic properties of engineered opsin tools affect optogenetic interactions with local circuit activity and should be a key factor in experimental design.'
