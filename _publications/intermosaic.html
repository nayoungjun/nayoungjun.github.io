title: "Inter-Mosaic Coordination of Retinal Receptive Fields"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/intermosaic
excerpt: 'We determined how ON and OFF receptive field mosaics should be arranged to optimize the encoding of natural scenes using theory and modeling. We found that information is maximized when these mosaics are anti-aligned. We tested this prediction by using large-scale measurements of RGC population responses to estimate RF mosaics of multiple RGC types from rat and primate. We found that ON and OFF RGC pairs with similar feature selectivity exhibit anti-aligned RF mosaics, consistent with theory. ON and OFF types that encode distinct features exhibit independent mosaics. These results extend the ‘efficient coding’ idea beyond the RFs of individual cells to predict how populations of diverse RGC types are spatially arranged.'
