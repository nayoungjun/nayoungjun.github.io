I’m a PhD Candidate studying computational neuroscience at Duke University, jointly advised in the [Pearson Lab](https://pearsonlab.github.io/) and the [Field Lab](https://www.neuro.duke.edu/research/faculty-labs/field-lab). I am focusing on computational understanding of retinal information processing using deep neural networks and information theory. In the future, I hope to apply the understanding of neural information processing to the general brain-machine interface and develop visual prosthetics. 

In the past, I received my Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering at Yale University in the [Cardin Lab](http://cardinlab.org/), where I studied distinct patterns of network activity caused by Channelrhodopsin variants. After graduation, I worked on retinal circuitry in the [Demb Lab](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/jonathan_demb/?tab=research) at Yale.
