Research experience
======

### Field Lab (PI: Greg Field) &amp; Pearson Lab (PI: John Pearson)
  - Jul 2018 - Present
  - Doctoral Thesis Research, Duke University
  - Computational understanding of retinal information processing based on the efficient coding principle.

### Groh Lab (PI: Jennifer Groh), Duke University
  - Apr 2018 - Jun 2018
  - First year Ph.D. rotations, Duke University
  - Analyzed patterns of neural correlations and time-division multiplexing in visual cortex (V1, V4) with respect to the number of objects in the visual field.

### Grill Lab (PI: Warren Grill)
  - Jan 2018 - Apr 2018
  - First year Ph.D. rotations, Duke University
  - Single-unit recordings of Parkinsonian Rat brain during DBS stimulation to understand how DBS affects brain plasticity.

### Kay Lab (PI: Jeremy Kay)
  - Sep 2017 - Jan 2018
  - First year Ph.D. rotations, Duke University
  - Live-imaging of microglial function in the retina.

### Demb Lab (PI: Jonathan B. Demb)
  - Jul 2015 - Aug 2017
  - Postgraduate Research Associate, Yale University
  - Elucidated cellular mechanisms for visual processing by the retina.
	- Characterized new cell types in the mouse retina, which can be defined based on their structure, function and gene expression.
	- Pursued intersectional strategy between Cre and Flop recombinase driven by different promoters and expression of proteins and genetic expression pattern.

### Cardin Lab (PI: Jessica A. Cardin)
  - Aug 2014 - May 2015
  - Master's Thesis Research, Yale University
  - Studied spontaneous and activated optogenetic tool-induced gamma oscillations in the mouse visual cortex <i>in vivo</i>.
  - Injected several novel optogenetic tools (Chrimson, Chronos, SwiChR) and Channelrodopsin2 to the V1 cortex of mice brain and compared their <i>in vivo</i> activation.
	- Conducted extracellular recording to compare spike rates and local field potential between mice with different optogenetic tools.

### Advanced Computational Vision (Instructor: Steven Zucker)
  - Jan 2015 - May 2015
  - Class Final Project, Yale University
	- Used machine learning methods to generate a neural signal classifier that distinguishes between the brain states: awake or anesthetized, moving or not moving, receiving visual stimuli or not.
	- Developed a neural signal classifier to identify cortex layers where the neural signal originated.
