title: "How do multiple sensor types lead to more efficient neural encoding architectures?"
excerpt: "In the retina, bipolar cells are located between input photoreceptors and output RGCs, allowing multiple stages of nonlinear processing. There are multiple types of bipolar cells, with each type known to be activated by specific attributes of visual stimuli such as luminance and the presence or absence of colored inputs. Whatâ€™s the role of these specialized sensor types in information processing? Can architecture and the neural diversity found in the retina make information processing more efficient?"
