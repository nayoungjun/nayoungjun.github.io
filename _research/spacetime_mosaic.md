title: "There are so, so many cell types in the retina. What is the optimal number of receptive field types for encoding natural videos?"
excerpt: "<p><video src='/files/thebestvideoever.mp4' width='100%' controls playsinline autoplay muted loop></video></p>Cell types with progressively larger spatial RFs and briefer temporal RFs form serially as more number of neurons are available. Efficient coding can explain cell type diversity in the retina as well!"
