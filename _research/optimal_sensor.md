title: "Which retinal sensor architectures are optimal for encoding natural scenes?"
excerpt: "Many sensory systems consist of ensembles or grids of ON and OFF detectors spanning sensory space. How should grids of ON and OFF detectors be arranged to optimally encode natural stimuli? It turns out that the preferred detector arrangements depends on sensor noise and the statistical structure of the natural stimuli.
